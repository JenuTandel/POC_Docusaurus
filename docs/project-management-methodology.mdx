# Project Management Methodology

Our project management methodology follows a structured and agile approach to ensure efficiency, transparency, and alignment with business objectives. The methodology, as approved by Hari, integrates best practices from Agile frameworks while ensuring scalability for our all the products (Aekatra, Helpdesk, Asset Management).

We use the [Kanban methodology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/boards/kanban-overview?view=azure-devops) to visualize workflows, manage work in progress, and improve efficiency.

### Azure DevOps Ticket Lifecycle
To streamline task management and track project progress efficiently, we use Azure DevOps for managing the ticket lifecycle following the **Kanban methodology**. The ticket structure includes multiple levels to ensure clear categorization and prioritization of work items. Below is the breakdown of the ticket hierarchy:
1. **Epic** - Represents high-level initiatives or major project goals that span across multiple releases or sprints.

2. **Features** - Large functional components that contribute to the completion of an EPIC.

3. **User Story** - A granular requirement that details specific user needs and functionalities.

4. **Task** - Actionable work items derived from user stories, assigned to development teams.

5. **Bug** - Represents defects or issues identified in the application that need resolution.

6. **Suggestions** - A placeholder for ideas or enhancements that can improve the system.

7. **Advance** - This ticket is used for technical drafting during advanced activities. It generally contains frontend, backend, QA, and UI/UX technical details to facilitate comprehensive planning and execution.

This structured ticketing system ensures seamless tracking, collaboration, and transparency across different teams, enabling a structured yet flexible approach to project execution using the **Kanban methodology**.
